# CS330_FinalProject

Code for our CS 330 Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning Final Project:
Transfer and Meta-Learning in Graph Neural Networks: A Recommender System Approach

Code is divided into two main folders: Meta-Learning and Transfer_Learning 

/Transfer_Learning contains the code implementation of a GCN rating-prediction model, and scripts used for fine-tuning and joint-loss training experimentation 

/Meta-Learning contains the code base for the MAML and Meta-Graph implementations, the base VGAE link prediction model, and data-processing code
